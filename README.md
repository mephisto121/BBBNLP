# bbb_nlp_prediction
nlp models for blood brain barrier permeability
one bidirectional LSTM model, one bert and one roberta model for bbb prediction
if you want to use the dataset please cite the group that made it(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01069-5)
the lstm model is uploaded in it's folder and for using the both bert and roberta models you can use huggingface website
bbb_smiles_prediction(roberta) = 'Parsa/BBB_prediction_finetuned_classification'
bbb_iupac_prediction(bert) = 'Parsa/BBB_prediction_finetuned_classification_iupac'
for using the lstm model, check out it's folder
